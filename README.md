- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Dynamic interactivity, animations, and user interactions

### Design Approach:

- **Mobile-first responsive design** for optimal viewing on all devices
- **Clean and user-friendly interface** with modern design principles
- **Modular separation** of HTML, CSS, and JS files for maintainability
- **Interactive animations** and smooth transitions for enhanced UX
- **Cross-browser compatibility** with vendor prefixes and fallbacks

### Key Features:

- Responsive navigation with mobile hamburger menu
- Smooth scrolling and section-based navigation
- Interactive skill cards with hover effects
- Animated timeline for education history
- Contact form with validation and notifications
- Resume download functionality with animation
- Parallax effects and scroll-based animations
- Performance-optimized with debounced scroll events
